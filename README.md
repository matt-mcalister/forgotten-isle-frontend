# Forgotten Isle

## What is this?

Forgotten Isle is an online version of the collaborative, adventure board game “Forbidden Island” by GameWright. This repo is for the frontend (react), to see the backend (rails), [click here](https://github.com/matt-mcalister/forgotten-isle-backend).

## Usage Tips

From the landing page, all you need to do is enter a username and click “Adventure!” to enter the island.

Once you’re on the island, you have the choice of creating a game or joining a game. Each game is one of four difficulty levels, ranging from “Novice” to “Legendary”. If this is your first time on the island, I would recommend playing on “Novice”, as it’s very difficult.

#### Gameplay

Once you are in a game, you’ll be able to chat with other player in the chatwindow. If you would like instructions on how to play the game, simply type “help” into the chat window.

When you are ready to start the game, simply click the green “Ready Up”. Once all players have readied-up, a “Begin Game” button will appear that allows you to commence gameplay.
